# SQL Data Analytics Project

This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts built on top of my **Data Warehouse Project**, which follows the **Bronze–Silver–Gold layer architecture**.  
The scripts in this repo focus on exploring the **cleaned (Silver/Gold)** data to perform **business analysis, data segmentation, performance tracking, and reporting**.

---

## 🧱 Project Context

This project is a continuation of my [Data Warehouse Project](../data-warehouse-project), where:
- **Bronze Layer**: Raw ERP and CRM data were extracted.
- **Silver Layer**: Data was cleaned, transformed, and standardized.
- **Gold Layer**: Analytical models were created for reporting.

This repository represents the **analytics stage**, where SQL is used to generate insights from the cleaned (Gold) data.
